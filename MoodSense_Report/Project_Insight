😌 MoodSense Analytics Dashboard – Smart Wearable Integration
This Power BI project visualizes physiological and behavioral data collected from a smart wearable band prototype, aimed at analyzing mood patterns, stress indicators, and well-being metrics.

Developed as part of the Ideathon organized by NERDS Robotics Club, NIT Silchar, this dashboard forms the analytical front-end of the MoodSense system — an intelligent mood tracking solution using biosensors like GSR and HRV to monitor mental wellness in real time.

🔁 This dashboard displays 30 days of personal health and mood data recorded from a single individual using the smart wearable band.

🧠 Project Objective
To visualize and interpret health & mood metrics from a smart band prototype using Power BI, providing real-time insights into stress, happiness, sleep quality, and physical activity.

📊 Key Dashboard Features
✅ KPI Cards (Top Metrics)
Avg. Body Temperature (°C)

Avg. Calories Burned

Avg. Stress Level (0-100)

Avg. Steps Count

Avg. Sleep Quality (%)

📈 Bio-Signal Trends
GSR (Galvanic Skin Response) & HRV (Heart Rate Variability) trends over time

Monitored across date ranges using time slicers

🧩 Analysis Based on User Remarks
Donut chart classification of user-submitted mood remarks (e.g., Energetic, Tired, Relaxed, etc.)

Dynamically updates with filters

🌡️ Body Temperature Distribution
Bar chart showing frequency of temperature readings

💡 Ideathon Concept
This dashboard is part of the MoodSense Smart Band concept presented at the NERDS Robotics Club Ideathon, NIT Silchar. The wearable collects biometric signals like:

GSR (Skin Conductance)

HRV (Heart Rhythm)

Body Temperature

Step Count

Sleep Cycles

The data is then analyzed via this Power BI dashboard to detect:

Early signs of stress or fatigue

Variations in sleep or physical activity

Patterns linked to emotional states or environmental changes
